      <p><a<p>I am currently a Satellite Communications Technichian. I travel around the country Installing satellite systems for state lottery.
            I have been doing this type of work for the past 20 years. I believe that I have mastered my current position.
          </p>
          <p1>I am also getting tired of traveling for work.
            Living out of a suite case and a hotel room gets old very quickly.
            I have been married for 21 years and I have 4 children. This is why I
            am currently learning web development to get off of the road and be home for my family.</a></p>
